		        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
		        <p>The running joke about Miami is that it's great, because it's "so close to the United States!" The metropolitan area, which is comprised of 34 municipalities and Miami-Dade County itself, is unique not only because of its substantial Latin American population, but also because of its geographical location and its position as the financial capital of Latin America. It's also one of the largest cruise ship ports in the world and as such, a major tourist hub.</p>

				<p>Miami-Dade County as a government is the second-largest governing body in the state, second only to the state of Florida itself. The mayor, <a href="http://www.miamidade.gov/mayor/">Carlos Giménez</a>, is a strong mayor who has made significant changes to the government since taking office in 2011. Currently, the County, which is home to 2.5 million residents, employs some 26,000 employees and operates on a $6 billion annual budget. The County's authority supersedes the many municipal governments that collectively make up "Miami," including the City of Miami, Miami Beach, Coral Gables, and 31 others. The County also provides city services to the unincorporated municipal service area, often referred to as UMSA. </p>
				
				<p>Miami-Dade County applied as a Code for America partner government seeking help with its Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), a massive department that resulted from the Mayor's consolidation of 12 departments into one. RER oversees everything from building permits and zoning to film permits, tree removal, and small business licensing. The County is not known for its transparency or ease of use, and RER is certainly an opaque department with a massive impact on daily life in Miami.</p>
				
				<p>During February residency, the Fellows discovered a number of challenges facing the County and mulled over a number of possible interventions. The overarching themes of the most interesting challenges and interventions quickly became clear: transparency and engagement. The County's practices and procedures are largely opaque, a situation that isn't helped by a Byzantine web presence and the language barrier that comes when half of your population doesn't speak English. Other cultural and language barriers also likely contribute to a very low citizen engagement rate with the government.</p>
				
				<p>As a result of extensive research in February and beyond, the Fellows have selected a primary project that focuses on closing the feedback loop between the County and its clients, as well as several side projects that support the overall goals of increasing transparency and engagement in Miami-Dade County.</p>

				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<h4>How can we use technology to usher in an era of transparent communication between Miami-Dade County, businesses and engaged citizens?</h4>
				
			</section>

			<section id='context'>
				
				<h2>The Context</h2>
				<p>Miami-Dade County is home to 2.5 million residents, many of whom are foreign-born or first-generation citizens. Taken on the whole, the people of the County are disengaged from their government, resulting in a routinely low voter turnout and a seeming disinterest in taking part in their own governance. This lack of engagement stems from people's previous experiences with government, the County's own opaque practices and processes, and a sense in the community that the government is simply not listening.</p>

<p>Those times that people do engage with their government, in the context of our work in the County, are when they either need something (like heavy trash pickup or a building permit), or when they've gotten in trouble for something (like when their new deck is out of compliance with the building code). 

<p>Lack of engagement can also be partly attributed to the sense that the constituency has that the County is simply not listening. A lack of response after having left feedback is par for the course, and disincentivizes future engagement.</p>

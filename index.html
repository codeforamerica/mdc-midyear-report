		        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
		        <p>The running joke about Miami is that it's great, because it's "so close to the United States!" The metropolitan area, which is comprised of 34 municipalities and Miami-Dade County itself, is unique not only because of its substantial Latin American population, but also because of its geographical location and its position as the financial capital of Latin America. It's also one of the largest cruise ship ports in the world and as such, a major tourist hub.</p>

				<p>Miami-Dade County applied as a Code for America partner government seeking help with its Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), a massive department that resulted from the Mayor's consolidation of 12 departments into one. RER oversees everything from building permits and zoning to film permits, environmental resource management, and small business licensing.</p>
				
				<p>During February residency, the Fellows discovered many challenges facing the County and mulled over a number of possible interventions. The overarching themes of the most interesting challenges and interventions quickly became clear: transparency and engagement. The County's practices and procedures are largely opaque, a situation that isn't helped by a Byzantine web presence and language barrier that comes when half of your population doesn't speak English. Other cultural and language barriers also likely contribute to a very low citizen engagement rate with the government.</p>
				
				<p>As a result of extensive research in February and beyond, the Fellows have selected a primary project that focuses on closing the feedback loop between the County and its citizens, as well as several side projects that support the overall goals of increasing transparency and engagement in Miami-Dade County.</p>

				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<h4>How can we use technology to usher in an era of transparent communication between Miami-Dade County, businesses and engaged citizens?</h4>
				
			</section>

			<section id='context'>
				
				<h2>The Context</h2>
				<p>Miami-Dade County is home to 2.5 million residents, many of whom are foreign-born or first-generation citizens. Taken on the whole, the people of the County are disengaged from their government, resulting in a routinely low voter turnout and a seeming disinterest in taking part in their own governance. This lack of engagement stems from people's previous experiences with government, the County's own opaque practices and processes, and a sense in the community that the government is simply not listening.</p>
				
				<p>Of this 2.5 million-person population, roughly half live in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, referred to as UMSA. Roughly half are also primarily Spanish speakers, with little to no English at their disposal. Visitors to Miami are just as likely to hear Spanish (or Kreyole) as often as English. Miami's location on the southern end of Florida, and its proximity to Cuba and Latin America make it a perfect location for international shipping and banking in Latin America. If you happen to be on Miami Beach or near the urban core, you may hear other languages spoken as well, a product of Miami's status as a tourist and cruise-ship hub.</p>
				
				<p>Miami-Dade County as a government is the second-largest governing body in the state, second only to the state of Florida itself. The mayor, <a href="http://www.miamidade.gov/mayor/">Carlos Giménez</a>, is a strong mayor who has made significant changes to the government since taking office in 2011. Currently, the County, which is home to 2.5 million residents, employs some 26,000 employees and operates on a $6 billion annual budget. The County's authority supersedes the many municipal governments that collectively make up "Miami," including the City of Miami, Miami Beach, Coral Gables, and 31 others. The County also provides city services to the unincorporated municipal service area, often referred to as UMSA. </p>
				

				<p>Those times that people do engage with their government, in the context of our research and experience, are when they either need something (like heavy trash pickup or a building permit), or when they've gotten in trouble for something (like when their new deck is out of compliance with the building code). The general sentiment is that although it's leaps and bounds better than some of the municipal governments, working with Miami-Dade County is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive.</p>

				<p>Because our funding is coming from the Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), our focus has fallen especially hard on building and permitting. This is a part of the County that sees a lot of traffic and generates a lot of revenue, as anyone wishing to build or modify a building in the area is required to go through the County (as well as whatever municipality they're located in).</p>


			</section>


			<section id='reason'>
				
				<h2>The Reason Why</h2>
				
				<p>The Fellows have seen huge disconnects in this area, between the perceptions the people have of the processes, and the perception the County has. The County's motto is "Delivering Excellence Every Day," and it's a sincere motto: County employees do in all earnestness work to provide their customers the best service possible. The customers, on the other hand, don't necessarily feel that to be the case: they're often frustrated by a lack of information about building and permitting or sticker-shocked at the cashiers' counters. The tendency is to place the blame for these negative feelings and experiences not necessarily on County employees themselves, but on the County on the whole.</p>
				
			</section>


			<section id='goals'>
				
				<h2>The Goals</h2>
				
				<p>Encourage and support transparency on the part of the County government by: </p>
				<ul>
					
					<li>Encourage the writing & acceptance of an open data policy, to go with their existing open data portal.</li>
					<li>Encourage the continued addition of data sets to the existing open data portal. </li>
					<li>Encourage the gathering of feedback and the subsequent ACTION on that feedback. </li>
					<li>Encourage community engagement with the County government by demonstrating that feedback is being heard (at the least) and acted upon (best case scenario). </li>

				</ul>
			</section>


			<section id='strategy'>
				
				<h2>The Strategy</h2>
				<p>We’re looking to encourage engagement with the county by adding transparency to the current feedback process at the PIC (pilot project) specifically, and more generally by encouraging the county to open up their data even more than they have already. This entails revamping the existing feedback loop by:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Making the process bilingual as roughly 50% of the citizenry is more comfortable in Spanish than English</li>
					<li>Automate the collection and initial analysis of feedback from the public</li>
					<li>Display the feedback/metrics in an attractive, easy-to-understand at-a-glance view intended for the County stakeholders, but accessible by the public as well</li>
					<li>Contribute collected data to the open data portal</li>
				</ul>

				<p>We’ll also be working on side projects intended to support transparency in short-term event permitting, business licensing, and 311 as well as the open data portal.</p>
				
			</section>

			<section id="work">
				
				<h2>The Work (so far)</h2>
				<p>What we have built can be divided into quick wins and major projects.</p>

				<h4>Quick Wins</h4>

				<p>Miami-Dade County is unique in that not only does it offer county services, but it offers city services to the approximately 1.2 million people living in the Unincorporated Municipal Service Area (UMSA). However, folks living in the unincorporated areas still have a postal address of Miami, which can be confusing since those addresses are outside the city boundaries of Miami and do not receive city of Miami services.</p>
				
				<p>A quick tech project to address this was that we localized two CFA projects locally; one project is a localization of the US Census API - https://github.com/codeforamerica/mdc-municipality-geo-api - which takes a shapefile and creates web services for developers to easily find what municipality you’re in.</p>
				
				<p>The other project is a localization of the 2012 Am I In Las Vegas project called Am I In Miami - http://amiinmiami.herokuapp.com . This takes the same concept of helping users understand county versus city but in a clearer interface.</p>
				
				<hr></hr>


				<p>Miami-Dade County Google Analytics dashboard - https://ancient-basin-7852.herokuapp.com/ - as a proof of concept of the types of projects fellows could implement, on our first day of our research trip to Miami we spun off a Google Analytics dashboard for Miami-Dade County.</p>
				
				
				<p>AgendaBot 305 - https://twitter.com/agendabot305 - when we briefly looked into projects dealing with agendas for county commissioner meetings, we built a quick app that would tweet out whenever a recording of a meeting was available.</p>
				
				
				<p>311 KB Master Template using Animal Services Department (ASD) topics: We helped Jaime, a staff member at CIAO, with Knowledge Base (KB) Templates related to ASD spay practices, using best practices at Code for America that bring optimal user-friendly web content.</p>



				<h4>Major Projects</h4>

				<p>A feedback platform that brings in data from multiple channels, with the goal to run analysis so they can give better guidance to policy makers.</p> 
				
				<p>Short-term Events Summit: In mid-April we brought key stakeholders of the short-term/special events permitting process from the county to be in one room for an “elephant drawing” exercise, with the goal of mapping a process in its entirety. </p>
				
				<p>From there we produced a guide to help people going through the short-term events permitting process for the first time. Our hope is to continue iterating on both the content and the format.</p>
				
				<p>Before: Permitting Procedures for Short Term Events (http://www.miamidade.gov/permits/library/brochures/short-term-events.pdf) - an existing pamphlet used by the Miami-Dade Building department.</p>
				
				<p>After: The User Guide to Short Term Events Permitting in UMSA - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HZUfvZBcLxPakpjawR8OHSdjFeyju7FmXemj8_jU4hQ/edit </p>

			<section id='timeline'>
				
				<h2>The Timeline</h2>
				
				January: training, build week project that gave us an introduction to the rabbit hole that is the PIC
	February: residency. met with [list of people who are still relevant], dipped toes into the PIC and got to know the city a little better
	March: ideas phase. started with 140+, spent a lot of time synthesizing research, making further connections. Ernie built agendabot305, began instagram project and trying to figure out what the Main Attraction was going to be. Eventually narrowed the 140+ down to 10, then down to 1: feedback, after talking with staff and seeking advice. Side projects continued: open data support, STEP process, instagram. Planned return trip to Miami.
	April: further refined feedback idea and planned research events onsite in Miami. Returned to Miami. Hosted STEP event for stakeholders, conducted user research at the PIC. Each of us took a much needed break and continued to analyze what we’d learned while onsite.
	May: drew our own elephant to map out what we envision our final project to be. Set milestones and deadlines for BETA and mid-year and began asking for access to the relevant county data sets. Examined surveying tools and decided on entry points, questions and possible metrics. Created surveys in two languages. Stood up Typeform. Connect311 meeting. Ernie’s participation as Brigade member in open data open letter. Began work on functional prototype of feedback system, including wireframes and data analysis stack.

		        <h2>What's Next</h2>
		        <p>Continuing community involvement with local organizations, businesses and groups to push the county’s needle forward in getting an open data policy and more accessible civic data</p>


				<p>Continue with individual side projects.</p>
				<p>Sophia is working on a study of getting a business license in San Francisco, CA and in Miami-Dade County, Fla.</p>
<p>Mathias and Ernie have been localizing the CFA Connect app to work for SF 311, where Mathias worked before joining the Fellowship. The hope is that should it prove successful we’ll see if its relevance for Miami-Dade’s 311 system. </p>
<p>Ernie is doing an assortment of things he doesn’t know where to begin with.</p>
